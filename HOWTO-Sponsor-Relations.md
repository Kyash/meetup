# Sponsor Relations

(TODO: Write more, more, more)

(Note: For the time being there will only be descriptions about how the Beacon planners have been doing things, but we should provide alternatives, as sponsor strategies should be flexible depending on the local market)

## Materials

Beacon (as of this writing "plans to", but in the future we should make this something that we can readily provide to any potential organizer) provides materials that can describe

* What ideas/golans Beacon stands for (in enterprise-lingo)
* Multi-media resource describing the event
* Flyers for the casual attendees

These are material that do not frequently change, and hence Beacon will provide them.

If you are a new organizer, you MUST prepare staff to keep record of what your Beacon was like. This may include photographs, videos, and blog posts. These SHOULD be released under terms that allow non-commercial use with proper attribution. (Note: We may need to create a special case for usage within the Beacon framework -- as it *may* be necessary for Beacon to create commercial material)

## Pitching

Here are some advice that may be able to help you better prepare yourself to convince potential sponsors:

### Do NOT Assume

We suppose you will have to explain and discuss about the merits of sponsoring a Beacon. You MUST keep in mind that those making the financial decisions are not necessary those who understand what Beacon stands for. Therefore, you MUST NOT assume that potential sponsors will automatically understand the value that sponsoring a Beacon will bring.

### Do NOT Show Up With An Empty Plan

More often than not, good-will sponsors are eager to help you, but they do not know how to help you at all. Your pitch should not be a simple "Sponsor us!" because then you will look like you only care about the money they will be giving you -- which is something that you MUST not think. Beacon organizers MUST aim to hold the conference that can bring satisfaction to both the attendees and the sponsors.

In Beacon we do not offer "Platinum", "Gold", "Silver", "Bronze" sponsorship packages precisely for this reason. We feel that such packages are vague in terms of merits to the sponsor, and provide little value to them other than the amount of that will be billed to them. Instead you should provide concrete items describing possible ways in which they can help you for how much, and exactly what sort of compensation the sponsors will receive. We call this the "Sponsor Menu"

(Note: Write more about this)
