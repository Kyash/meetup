# Swags

## How to specify/choose swags

Roughly speaking, there are two types of swags: Ones that you (the organizer) prepare, and ones that the sponsors will bring.

## Sponsor Swags

You generally do not need to care much about the specifics of these types of swags. However you should set the specifications/expecations in advance. Namely,

* Do you allow your sponsors to distribute swags at booths/hallways?
* Do you allow your sponsors to include swags along with the handout materials to your attendees?
* Is there size specification/limits?
* How many (types of) swags do you allow your sponsors to bring?
* How many swags should the sponsors bring?

Below is the way that we have been doing things in the past. This is by no means a definitive guide, and you should tweak the specifications depending on your event:

* Each sponsor get the right to include ONE swag in the swag bag that we distribute.
* Swags must be smaller than A4-size paper, and the size should not be excessive that it does not fit in a swag bag that can hold an A4-size paper.
* Unless the sponsors have reached prior agreement as such, they are NOT allowed to distribute swags in booths/hallways.
* Swags are expected to be handed to paid-ticket attendees only. This usually turns out to be somewhere around 70~80% of the total number of attendees.

In this scenario each sponsor is limited to a single swag that can be included in our swag bag. 

Providing a bag was important, as we did not want to inconvenience the audience with various handouts. It also sets the expectations on the size of swags for the sponsors nicely (it conincidentally rules out sponsor T shirts, which usually conflict with our own conference T shirts)

The rule that binds each sponsor to 1 swag is mainly there to keep the playing field level between all sponsors. Even the lowest paying sponsor get a chance at handing out swags/leaflets to every paid attendee. For those who want to do extra things using a booth, we chard extra for this type of sponsorship.

Finally, from our experience, we usually see that 10~20% of total attendees are some sort of unpaid guests. While these guests are welcome to enjoy our event, history teaches us that the chances that a person will not show up at the conference increaases significantly when you have not paid for it. For this reason, we have been limiting swags to paid customers only.
