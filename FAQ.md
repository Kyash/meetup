# FAQ

## You say "all topics on technology are welcome". Isn't that kind of impossible?

Yes, catering to all audiences is impossible -- if you only have 1 conference. The design of Beacon is intentionally loose in terms of talk subject precisely for this reason.

For example, person A might want to hold a conference that focuses more on mobile devices. Another person might want to focus more on a middleware's best practice usage.

This would totally be fine: The scope of Beacon does NOT exclude you from organizing a conference focusing on a particular subject. The spirit of all-inclusiveness should stay, but it's totally okay to do focus.

What we are trying to standardize here is the user experience of attending these conferences. It's okay to hold a 200 person event on technology X, a 50 person event on technology Y (XXX Note: we may require you to name your conference appropriately, such as Beacon::X, Beacon::Y). Most other instances of Beacon should probably be about a broader topic, but it's totally okay.
