## Is this about carpentry and construction? Or maybe IoT?

No. This conference is intended for the _digital_ builders of the modern world.

The community from which this conference emerged from primarily consists of people from Web/Mobile area, and therefore some weight will be placed on those topics. The point, however, is that we would like to welcome almost any subject matter provided that there is enough technical content that the intended audience can enjoy.

## If you host small conferences, wouldn't it be just a string of small meetups?

Yes and no. Yes, it will be just a string of small meetups if we just let everything loose. We believe we can work out both large and small conferences to feel like part of one cohesive set of events, but details are still forming as we speak. Also see: "You say "all topics on technology are welcome". Isn't that kind of impossible?"

## You say "all topics on technology are welcome". Isn't that kind of impossible?

Yes, catering to all audiences is impossible -- if you only have 1 conference. The design of builderscon is intentionally loose in terms of talk subject precisely for this reason.

For example, person A might want to hold a conference that focuses more on mobile devices. Another person might want to focus more on a middleware's best practice usage.

This would totally be fine: The scope of builderscon does NOT exclude you from organizing a conference focusing on a particular subject. The spirit of all-inclusiveness should stay, but it's totally okay to do focus.

What we are trying to standardize here is the user experience of attending these conferences. It's okay to hold a 200 person event on technology X, a 50 person event on technology Y (XXX Note: we may require you to name your conference appropriately, such as builderscon::X, builderscon::Y). Most other instances of builderscon should probably be about a broader topic, but it's totally okay.
