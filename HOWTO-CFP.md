# Call For Paper/Participations

Like any conference, the main attraction for Beacon is the talks that the participants bring.

You should treat your would-be participants with as much respect as you can, provided that they do not make it problematic to proceed with the event organization.

## Content To Call For

* You MUST make absolutely clear in your CFP site is that this is a conference for people who MAKE stuff. The audience expects to learn from and about the speakers' experience.
* You SHOULD NOT
* You SHOULD NOT rule out for profit entities, but you MUST NOT give the impression that it's okay to give a sales spiel about a product.
* Having said that, it is OK to include such material as long as it's not the main content.

Examples of talks that you may want to include:

* "How we built X (obstacles that we faced, and how we solved them)"
* "Discussion about technologies behind X (which ones were chosen, why they were chosen, and problems, if any)"

These are good candidates because you can most likely expect to listen to the speaker's experience (good or bad).

Examples of talks that you probably do NOT want to include:

* "Introduction to cool technlogy new site/framework/technology in 30 minutes!"

These are probably not good fit for Beacon, as usually they just talk about
the product's features. Remember: you want to invite people that can give
talks that are worth actually listening to -- not talks that only describe
the same content as the FAQ page or the product brochure.

* You MUST ask for consent on being recorded and/or photographed.

## Feedback

* You MUST give specific dates for you to return feedback to talk submissions as to if they were accepted or not.
* You MUST allow ample time between the feedback and the event itself, preferrable over 1 month.

(Note: the idea here is to make sure the would-be speakers feel comfortable about the process. Do NOT let them hanging)

## Confirmation

* You MUST create a mechanism to receive confirmation for accepted talks
* You SHOULD disqualify any talks that do not get confirmed in a reasonable amount of time.
