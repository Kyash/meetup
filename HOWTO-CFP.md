# Call For Paper/Participations

[日本語](translations/ja/HOWTO-CFP.md)

Like any conference, the main attraction for builderscon is the talks that the participants bring.

You should treat your would-be participants with as much respect as you can, provided that they do not make it problematic to proceed with the event organization.

## Content To Call For

* You MUST make absolutely clear in your CFP site is that this is a conference for people who MAKE stuff. The audience expects to learn from and about the speakers' experience.
* You SHOULD NOT rule out for profit entities, but you MUST NOT give the impression that it's okay to give a sales spiel about a product.
* Having said that, it is OK to include such material as long as it's not the main content.

Examples of talks that you may want to include:

* "How we built X (obstacles that we faced, and how we solved them)"
* "Discussion about technologies behind X (which ones were chosen, why they were chosen, and problems, if any)"

These are good candidates because you can most likely expect to listen to the speaker's experience (good or bad).

Examples of talks that you probably do NOT want to include:

* "Introduction to cool technlogy new site/framework/technology in 30 minutes!"

These are probably not good fit for builderscon, as usually they just talk about
the product's features. Remember: you want to invite people that can give
talks that are worth actually listening to -- not talks that only describe
the same content as the FAQ page or the product brochure.

* You MUST ask for consent on being recorded and/or photographed.

### Tip: How To Set Prospective Speakers' Expectations 

Prospective speakers sometimes do not know if the subject that they would like
to submit fits the conference. This is a situation we would like to avoid as much as possible.

Many conferences list possible topic for talks that they would like to see: e.g.
"Language", "Community", "Big Data", "Career Development", etc. These are
good indicators, but can be too restrictive for conference like builderscon.
Speakers may be lead to thinking that the listed topics are the only topics
which will be accepted, when it's not that case.

Instead, consider wording your CFP in such a way that you tell your speakers
what you want the audience to get as a result of watching their talks. For
example:

* "We are looking for talks that allow beginners to enjoy and learn something new"
* "We welcome talks that appeal to professionals with 10+ yrs of experience"
* "Talks that will enlighten us about fields which are are not generally considered mainstream to Web engineers are highly appreciated"

Also, consider announcing guest/keynote speakers before the CFP.
It is generally not a requirement to have guest speakers, but having examples
of speakers tell a whole lot more about the types of talks that people
can expect in your conference than a few hundred word essay on it.

## Format

Proposals MUST contain enough detail that prospective attendees will be
able to understand *exactly* what the talk is about. Proposals need not
be in proper essay format, but should at least contain bullet proof list
of items that will be discussed.

The exact amount of detail required will vary depending on many circumstances,
but do let them know that the difference in the amount of detail will have
an impact on which talks are selected.

Should you find proposals that require more detail, you may want to contact
the submitter directly and gently ask for more information for the talk to
have higher chance of acceptance.

## Feedback

* You MUST give specific dates for you to return feedback to talk submissions as to if they were accepted or not.
* You MUST allow ample time between the feedback and the event itself, preferrable over 1 month.

(Note: the idea here is to make sure the would-be speakers feel comfortable about the process. Do NOT let them hanging)

## Confirmation

* You MUST create a mechanism to receive confirmation for accepted talks
* You SHOULD disqualify any talks that do not get confirmed in a reasonable amount of time.

## Special Considerations

Conferences should try to be useful for sponsors. That is to say, the sponsors should get some sort of return of investment. However, as an organizer you MUST make sure the conference content does not simply conform to the wishes of your sponsors.

An example of a bad appease the sponsor is to give them a talk slot with not much restriction. A typical good will gone wrong scenario would involve a random tech person being assigned to speak, but without the passion or the understanding of the conference. You should recognize that this is not only bad for the conference, but bad for the sponsor -- failed talks delivered to your audience may in fact have a negative impact (as opposed to no impact).

If your sponsors insist on giving talks, make sure that they understand:

* The conference is about technology
* The audience WILL judge your company based on the content/quality of the presentation
* You MUST NOT use the talk slot to pitch a product or solution. Mentioning is is allowed, but it MUST NOT be the main content.

It is your responsibility as the organizer to make the conference worthwhile for your main audience, as well as for the sponsors. You MUST always keep the quality of the talks up to expectations to make this happen.
