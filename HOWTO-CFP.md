# Call For Paper/Participations

Like any conference, the main attraction for Beacon is the talks that the participants bring.
You should treat your would-be participants with as much respect as you can, provided that they do not make it problematic to proceed with the event organization.

## Content To Call For

* One thing that you MUST make absolutely clear in your CFP site is that this is a conference for people who MAKE stuff. The audience expects to learn from and about the speakers' experience.
* You SHOULD NOT rule out for profit entities, but you MUST NOT give the impression that it's okay to give a sales spiel about a product.
* Having said that, it is OK to include such material as long as it's not the main content.

* You MUST ask for consent on being recorded and/or photographed.

## Feedback

* You MUST give specific dates for you to return feedback to talk submissions as to if they were accepted or not.
* You MUST allow ample time between the feedback and the event itself, preferrable over 1 month.

(Note: the idea here is to make sure the would-be speakers feel comfortable about the process. Do NOT let them hanging)

## Confirmation

* You MUST create a mechanism to receive confirmation for accepted talks
* You SHOULD disqualify any talks that do not get confirmed in a reasonable amount of time.
