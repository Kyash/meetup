# Consent to Civility

builderscon organizers and attendees MUST adhere to our terms for "Consent to Civility".

Being civil means a lot of different things. We are being explicitly vague, because we are not here for a witch hunt. Organizers and attendees are expected to act in a manner that does not make others uncomfortable, feel threatened, or otherwise be hurt.

## Reporting / Reaction

Organizers MUST explicitly create communication channels that allow attendees to report should anything happen. Conversations related to reports MUST be kept private, unless local law requires otherwise.

Organizers MUST act swiftly upon recieving such reports. When incidents deal
with threats or possibility of threats, organizers MUST take proper course of
action including removal of accused from the conference.
