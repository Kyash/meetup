# builderscon

**builderscon** is a festival for engineers.

When you think about "Technical conferences", what do you expect?
When _we_ say we want to hold a conference, we actually mean a fun, laid down festival for anybody who wants to share their experiences, new ideas, and most of all, the love for technology.

Our roots can be found in the series of conferences called YAPC::Asia Tokyo, where, in spite of its name, programmers from almost any genre were welcome. It was a true polyglot conference. The focus of the conferences were on the engineers -- the "builders" of our age, and not a particular language, product, or a community. We just wanted to listen and talk about good, geeky, and satisfying stories related to our technology.

**builderscon** takes this spirit, and attempts to carry it further.  builderscon gathers anything and everything that is interesting, anything that the actual builders -- you -- are interested to discuss. We the audience want to hear about your passion on technology.
