# General Guidance

Note: Currently we only documet about venue selection in Tokyo/Japan.

Rough venue sizes that are available in the greater Tokyo area:

| Capacity  | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| Over 900  | You will need to book these in advance, at least *over* a year |
| 500       | Start looking for these around one year in advance |
| Below 100 | Plenty, you may want to consider using a sponsor's room |

# Tips

* Always visit the venue before hand.
* When you do, take pictures.
* When you take pictures of the venue, **including a person** for reference. This is extremely useful when you have to make those quick judgement calls.
