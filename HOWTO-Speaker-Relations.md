# Speaker Relations

## Information

Here are a list of things that you should make available to your speakers

### Aspect ratio of the screen/monitor

"16:9", "4:3", etc. This probably depends on the assigned room, so you probably should inform this as soon as you have a schedule ready

### Q&A time

By definition builderscon talks should include an extra 10 minutes for Q&A. You should explicitly state this fact to your speakers.
