# Speaker Relations

## Information

Here are a list of things that you should make available to your speakers

### How the session will proceed

Sessions in builderscon should proceed as follows:

1. Announcement that the talk will begin
2. Announcement of the speaker (name), and the title of the talk
3. Welcome applause
4. For 60 minute talks: a visual/audio reminder that there's 10 minutes left at 40 minutes into the talk.
5. For 60 or 30 minute talks: a visual/audio reminder that there's 5 minutes left at 45 or 25 minutes into the talk.
6. Start of Q&A.
7. Announcement stating that the talk is finished.

This should be clear to the speaker BEFORE the talk begins.

### Aspect ratio of the screen/monitor

"16:9", "4:3", etc. This probably depends on the assigned room, so you probably should inform this as soon as you have a schedule ready

### Q&A time

By definition builderscon talks should include an extra 10 minutes for Q&A. You should explicitly state this fact to your speakers.

## Miscellaneous Tips On Your Session

### Try to keep self-introduction brief

While it is always a good idea to tell your audience who you are, remember
that your audience is there to listen to your talk, not about you. Keep your
introduction brief, and save it for later when you meet them at the hallway
or at the conference dinner.
