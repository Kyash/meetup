# Catering

Catering is only required if your venue does not already provide some sort
of restaurant/catering services. In general we recommend that you host your
social/dinner/lunch at the venue (if possible) as that greatly reduces the
chances of your attendees not showing up.

Prices vary, but for a buffet style dinner with drinks, you should be looking
at somewhere around 3000 to 6000 JPY per person.
