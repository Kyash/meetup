# Staff Preparations

## Staff "Uniforms"

Organizers SHOULD make the event staff easily be identifiable by whatever
possible means. Uniforms are not necessary, but there should be some sort of
visual aid to do this.

In the past we have provided:

* Staff Only Shirts/T-Shirts 
* Staff Only Lanyards
* Armbands

to make it easy to identifiy who on the venue is a staff. This could probably
be achieved by other means (and if there are better ways, please let us know),
but so far we believe that the armband and/or T-shirts are the best way. Do
note that armbands have one major advantage over T-shirts, in that while
T-shirts usually get dirty after one day of usage and team members tend to
not wear it everyday on a multi-day conference, armbands usually do not have
this problem.
