# Staff Preparations

## Staff "Uniforms"

Organizers SHOULD make the event staff easily be identifiable by whatever
possible means. Uniforms are not necessary, but there should be some sort of
visual aid to do this.

In the past we have provided:

* Staff Only Shirts/T-Shirts 
* Staff Only Lanyards
* Armbands

to make it easy to identifiy who on the venue is a staff. This could probably
be achieved by other means (and if there are better ways, please let us know),
but so far we believe that the armband and/or T-shirts are the best way. Do
note that armbands have one major advantage over T-shirts, in that while
T-shirts usually get dirty after one day of usage and team members tend to
not wear it everyday on a multi-day conference, armbands usually do not have
this problem.

## Staff Roles

You SHOULD arrange enough staff to accomodate most, if not all of the following
roles:

### "Room Guides"

There SHOULD be staff in front/around a particular room to guide the audience
in/out of each room that the talks will be held. This is an easily forgotten,
but important role: Attenddees are not necessarily acquainted with your venue,
and often times they will be lost and/or unsure of the room that they want to
go to -- *even* in the presense of enough postings on the wall. Having a staff
as both a visual sign and a being able to ask if this is the right room makes
things much easier for the attendees.

# Room Occupancy

There SHOULD be ways for audiences to tell if a particular room is full or still
has room for additional audience. This should clearly be announced before hand.

TODO: Add concrete examples: Put up signs, use WiFi connection information to
approximate the occupancy, etc.

If possible, announce current status for each room on online media such as
twitter/slack/IRC, so that attendees can decide if they can/should take the
time to move to a different room
