## Enforcing The Code of Conduct

builderscon organizers and attendees MUST adhere to our [Code of Conduct](./Code-of-Conduct.md)

### Reporting / Reaction

Organizers MUST explicitly create communication channels that allow attendees to report should anything happen. Conversations related to reports MUST be kept private, unless local law requires otherwise.

Organizers MUST act swiftly upon recieving such reports. When incidents deal
with threats or possibility of threats, organizers MUST take proper course of
action including removal of accused from the conference.

## Insurance

You SHOULD prepare for accidents such as your staff or the attendees hurting themselves during the conference, and as a result perhaps damaging the venue. For small scale conferences this may not be a big issue, but if your conference grows to over several hundred people, you MUST consider taking an insurance policy.

(Note: This specific type of insurance may not exist everywhere) Most major insurance companies provide a so-called Event Insurance, which can cover damages to the venue or medical fees. The exact terms and price range will vary significantly depending on factors such as 

* The area in the venue used for the conference
* The number of attendees
* The coverage details

You should contact your local insurance company requesting for information on events. They usually have some sort of plan for you.

You SHOULD make it clear to your attendees the scope of such coverage. 

(Note: we need a document for prospective builderscon organizers to read, so that they agree that the main organizers/planners of builderscon cannot be held responsible for damages or lack of insurance coverage when an incident occurs)

## Permits

Depending on your venue, you may be required to provide paperwork stating that you will be hosting a gathering to the local authorities. In such cases, make sure to submit the necessary paperwork well before hand to obtain permits.
