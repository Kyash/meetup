## Insurance

You SHOULD prepare for accidents such as your staff or the attendees hurting themselves during the conference, and as a result perhaps damaging the venue. For small scale conferences this may not be a big issue, but if your conference grows to over several hundred people, you MUST consider taking an insurance policy.

(Note: This specific type of insurance may not exist everywhere) Most major insurance companies provide a so-called Event Insurance, which can cover damages to the venue or medical fees. The exact terms and price range will vary significantly depending on factors such as 

* The area in the venue used for the conference
* The number of attendees
* The coverage details

You should contact your local insurance company requesting for information on events. They usually have some sort of plan for you.
