# Team/Organization

## Organization

Nowadays it is important to have a cohesive structure within a conference organizer's team so that where certain responsibilities fall onto are clearly defined.

The details of how decisions are made, or who is responsible should be handled
independently based upon the needs of the actual persons running the organization, however we require that several persons with key responsibilities and roles be available at all times.

A single "chair" person MUST exist that can either be the person with ultimate ruling power / ultimately accountable for matters related to the conference in an organization with a centralized administration model, or be the person who can be the tie-breaker if using a comittee model.

TODO: I feel like there are more roles that should exist in all types of builderscon. Add more later

## Volunteers

Most likely your builderscon will require the help of at least a handful of
volunteers to run. How you manage your team will no doubt vary depending
on your location, financial situation, and many other conditions. Therefore
items on this section are not necessary rules, but just suggestions regarding
how to treat your volunteers

### In General: Treat your volunteers well

The biggest mistake we have seen regarding the treatment of volunteers is when
you only treat them as mere "resources". Instead, we would like to recommend 
that you treat them more like "extremely helpful attendees". The idea is for
them to have fun: you still many need to ask them to work hard, but that doesn't
mean you are free to just use their time. Be prepared so that the volunteers
can help you run your event without worrying about other things.

Here are somethings to keep in mind:

#### Prepare enough material for them to study before hand

Usually your volunteers are clueless how to run a conference. It is your
responsibility to prepare manuals and directions with enough information
so that they don't feel like they are at complete loss. Be clear what you
expect out of them, like meeting times, hours of operation, expected
expenses, etc.

#### Do not let your volunteers go hungry

Always factor in time and budget for food/drinks. Apetites vary from person
to person, but it's always a good idea to have enough food around.

#### Do not force your volunteers to pay money

Being volunteers, it is probably not unreasonable to expect them to pay for
transportation to the venue/meetings. But you should not rely on them to
pay for much more than that.

If you have expenses that you expect the volunteers to pay, do bring it up
front so they know what they are getting into.

Always remember that they are aready paying enough for you by offering
their time and effort.

#### Have some fun activities

If you have your volunteers help you only to let them go home immediately
afterwards, their experience will just be that: they came, they worked,
they went home (tired, no less). Always remember that you should make their
experience fun.

If you can afford to do so, create time for some activities before or after
the event, a drinkup, a barbecue, or whatever else suit your situation.
This is also a great way to build your team. We recommend that you have a 
gathering before the event. This will make sure that your volunteers know
about each other before hand.
