# Synopsis

This document is intendend to be read by those who are curious about what builderscon is.

## Abstract

`builderscon` is about *passion* for tech, a conference for all the people who love tech. `builderscon` grew out of a massively successful community driven polyglot event known as "YAPC::Asia Tokyo" which ran between 2006 and 2015.

The goal is simple: We want a "festival (お祭り)" for geeks who are passionate about technology.

The atmosphere is relaxed: You are welcome whatever your backgrounds are, as long as you share our love of technology. We welcome attendees from any tech community or expertise.

For conference sessions, we want to listen to talks that gets us engineers *excited*. Show us your crazy hacks. Tell us about your massive failures and how you solved these problems. Take us to unknown territories of future tech. And because in order to have speakers that are capable of giving us these stories, we do not limit the scope of talks to a particular computer language, community, etc. We may set particular themes for each instance, but in general the speakers are free to talk anything that fuels their passion. The only thing we ask is that you talk about things that gets the engineers motivated and excited: no listing of product specs, no introduction to your new Web application framework de jour, etc.

YAPC::Asia Tokyo was organized pretty much this way, and in particular in 2015, has attracted over 2,000 professional and aspiring engineers from all around. Us engineers are all craving to hear these talks. `builderscon` aims to take the spirit that made these events such a success, and bring it to the next level so more people can share their knowledge and experience.

Please come and share your passion! We want to hear your story!

## Attendees

The majority of the attendees are professional engineers. Historically (and probably because of the YAPC::Asia Tokyo heritage) there has been more attendees from web-related programmer and engineer sector, but this we hope to change in the coming years and diversify. However, we still expect our audience to consist mostly of engineers in their late twenties to early forties.

About 10%~20% of the attendees are expected to consist of students, aspiring engineers, and those who have recently started their careers as engineers.

## The Framework

`builderscon` is a conference, but it is also a specification and framework to build conferences: we provide the know-how on how to organize a successful conference, which people can freely use through our documents.

Conferences that implement the entire specifications and whoe are authorized by the main builderscon organizers may use the name `builderscon`. Other conferences that partially implement the specification can only claim to be "Powered by builderscon".

## For Potential Sponsors

`builderscon` is extremely grateful for the sponsors out there: without your help, it is almost impossible to create opportunities for wonderful events like this.

One of `builderscon`'s specification goal is to make sure that we strike the correct balance between keeping the integrity of the event and maximizing the sponsors' satisfaction. By sponsoring us, you will be able to appeal your brand to the core members of many communities. If you are interested, please contact us.
