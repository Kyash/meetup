# Media

While the main purpose of an event is to gather and have fun, the organizers MUST do everything they can to record what happened and properly release it to the world so that the World can know what Beacon is all about.

## Photographs

* You MUST take photographs during the event.
* You SHOULD use a professional photographer to do this. There are exceptions, but photos from enthusiasts are usually not comprable to those by professional photographers. Future participants will most likely see one of your photos to decide what Beacon is about: It is *extremely* important to make them best quality photographs that you can get.
* Photos MUST be released publicly. You MAY provide for-purchase or exclusively available photos, but ample photographs should be available for free, to benefit future Beacon events.

## Talk Videos

* Talk videos SHOULD be released, provided that you can get consent from your speakers.
* Videos released afterwards is preferred over live streaming if you can only offer one or the other.
* Videos SHOULD be released publicly.
