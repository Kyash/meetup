# Media

While the main purpose of an event is to gather and have fun, the organizers MUST do everything they can to record what happened and properly release it to the world so that the World can know what builderscon is all about.

## Photographs

* You MUST take photographs during the event.
* You SHOULD use a professional photographer to do this. There are exceptions, but photos from enthusiasts are usually not comprable to those by professional photographers. Future participants will most likely see one of your photos to decide what builderscon is about: It is *extremely* important to make them best quality photographs that you can get.
* Photos MUST be released publicly. You MAY provide for-purchase or exclusively available photos, but ample photographs should be available for free, to benefit future builderscon events.

## Talk Videos

* Talk videos SHOULD be released, provided that you can get consent from your speakers.
* Videos released afterwards is preferred over live streaming if you can only offer one or the other.
* Videos SHOULD be released publicly.
* Talk videos, if public, MUST show proper usage rights: distribution, commercial/non-commercial, etc.

### Video Transcripts and Translations

TODO: Need a proper how-to on ways to provide translations

Videos SHOULD have transcripts, and possibly translations. The master transcript MUST be in English -- therefore, if a talk is given in a language X, a transcript for that language AND a transcript for English must be created. After than, translations can be created for other languages in an as-needed basis.
