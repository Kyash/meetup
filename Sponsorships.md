# Sponsorships

We recommend `builderscon` organizers not to use a generic sponsorship plans that are commonly used, where a price tag is slapped onto plans named "platinum", "gold", "silver", etc.

We feel that while these plans are easier on the organizers, they present no value in helping the sponsors visualize what exactly their sponsorship fees will be used for. Also, generic plans like these may not include the specific type of sponsorship that they want: for example, previously we have had a sponsor come to us saying that while they would like to contribute a fairly large amount of money to our event, they did not want too much exposure. Upon listening to their reasoning, it made sense, but with generic plans, it becomes harder to find a good landing point where all sides can agree on.

We instead recommend coming up with a catalogue of sponsorship items that the sponsors can mix and match. In this document, we list a few possible items that have actually been used in the past. As a `builderscon` organizer, you are not obliged to use these exact items. Feel free to choose (or not choose) to use any of these, depending on your specific needs.

# List of possible items

## Backpanel sponsor

### Description

Place name/logo on backpanels, which are boards placed behind the speakers during presentations.

### Perks

Sponsor logo will show up on every photo/video. Official photos and videos will circulate indefinitely on the web. Speakers tend to use photos from conferences as their online profile photos as well, so extra exposure can be expected.

### Cost

Sponsors pays for 1 square of a backpanel. They may purchase multiple slots. Each backpanel may contain somewhere around 4~10 logos. Usually there is one backpanel per room.

### Responsibilities

Sponsor must provide high-resolution logo to be used.

## Lunch / Bento sponsor

### Description

Provide lunch/bento boxes to the attendees. 

### Cost

Approx. 600~1000 JPY per meal provided

### Perks

Sponsors may distribute leaflets or other swags with the lunch/bento boxes.

### Responsibilities

None

## Brochure/Pamphlet/Handout Advertisement sponsor

### Description

Conferences that hand out brochures/pamphlets/handours may utilize few pages on these to place advertisements from sponsors. These handouts usually contain vital information such as WiFi connection information, locations for lunch/bento boxes, information about keynote speakers, etc., so there is a very high chance of exposure to attendees. Also, you may choose to allow direct marketing messages on these ads, as they are relatively non-invasive.

### Cost

Varies. 1 slot of advertisement could cost anywhere from 50,000 JPY to 500,000 JPY depending on placement and number of attendees.

### Perks

As stated in the description, most attendees will look at these advertisements. Sponsors will also have much freedom with regards to the actual content of such advertisements

### Responsibilities

Sponsor must provide high-resolution advertisement data. Organizers must provide exact specification of the advertisement slot, and must make sure to check the advertisement data before hand to make sure they do not contain messages that are not appropriate for conferences.

## Swag Bag Sponsorship

### Description

Those who purchased this sponsorship can either 

* Provide us with just the design to place on the bags, or
* Provide us with the actual bags

The former option should be much more expensive than the latter (e.g. 2.5 times or so more). The benefit of the former for the sponsor is that they can will not need to spend money or keep track of number of bags they order. However, they will have no control over the final quality of the bag. The latter imposes more responsibilities to the sponsor, but they are in full control of quality of the bag, as well as having to pay less.

Make sure to order bags with gussets. Participants tend to collect a fair number of swags during the conference, and therefore is much easier for them to carry these in bags with gussets.

### Cost

Varies. Each bag costs about some where around $3 to $5 when ordered in bulk, so add the premium that your conference can ask for on top of this.

### Perks

Every attendee gets a bag and they will go home holding one, so the marketing ROI is pretty high. This is especially true in Japan where most attendees will use some sort of public transportation.

### Responsibilities

If the sponsor is providing the design only, then sponsor must provide high-resolution design data.
Organizers must provide exact specification of the bag.

If the sponsor is providing the entire bag, organizers must provide the number of bags that is required in advance.

For either options organizers must make sure to check the design data before hand to make sure they do not contain messages that are not appropriate for conferences.
